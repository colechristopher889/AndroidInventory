Android Inventory App 

   This is an unfinished Android app for inventory management. I plan to continue developing it for commercial use in the near future. I need a very simple app, development will continue as I become more familiar with the Android ecosystem.

   This app was designed to provide a simple inventory app with a login screen.
    
   The app includes a login screen with user database and a screen to display and edit an inventory database.  
    
   I decided to spend much of my time planning and reviewing code examples. In hindsight, I would have spent more time implementing features and testing and less time in the planning phase. Currently the app is functional but I want to change the UI to something more appealing.
    
   My code is functional. The testing process I followed was to load a proper VM and troubleshoot the code.
    
   I attempted to implement the SQLite code in a few different ways, I was ultimately successful. I will continue to develop this app.
